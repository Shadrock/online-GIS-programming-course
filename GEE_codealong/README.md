# Introduction to Google Earth Engine
This repos briefly lays out a "code along" exercise that I do with students to introduce them to [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/), which is a geospatial processing service that uses an in-browser developnment environment to access and analyize Google's enormous library of geospatial data. Everything runs in browser (I use Chrome just to be safe) so you don't have to have students install any additional software. However, students do need to sign up for the service and should have a Google account with space in their Google drive to hold any outputs.

## Purpose of the Code Along
I always try to introduce students to new technology and right now the hot trend is coding and, specifically, coding to access data and computing power in "[the cloud](https://www.zdnet.com/article/stop-saying-the-cloud-is-just-someone-elses-computer-because-its-not/)." It's also fun to introduce students to a new programming language and the language used by the Earth Engine IDE is JavaScript. Most students in this class have completed my 6 week module in Python programming and are comfortable with that language. Showing them that they can use their experience with Python to quickly pick up another language gives them a nice boost and, besides, it's fantastic to see outputs rendered on an interactive map.
