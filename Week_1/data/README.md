These are *archived* data sets that students can use if, for some reason, they have problem accessing the [OpenFlights data page](https://openflights.org/data.html) as specified in the tutorial.

The data here were downloaded in August of 2020. Note that file name conventions may have changed so be sure you adjust the code in the tutorial to match the files you download!
