These are *archived* data sets that students can use if, for some reason, they have problem accessing the DCâ€™s open data portal: specifically [their page on Planned Unit Developments](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/planned-unit-development-puds) and the [Affordable Housing page](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/affordable-housing) as specified in the tutorial. If students _do_ need to use these data, they should go in the `input` folder within the `gis` folder on their Google Drive, as specified in the tutorial. 

The data here were downloaded 7 September 2020. Note that file name conventions may have changed so be sure you adjust the code in the tutorial to match the files you download! For example, the original version of this tutorial was written for files using a double underscore `__` which _was_ a character used instead of spaces by the data provider. Subsequent downloads have shown that now they use a single underscore `_`. Be on the look out for stuff like this in file names!
