# Lab 3 Data Sorting and Plotting

In this lab we will be working to sort the COVID-19 cases in the United States and plotting them on Tableau for atleast 3 states.


Briefly explain the tutorial and link to any available external outputs, such as a Tableau map.   

### To complete this assignment you will need:
- A Google account or you can work on Jupyter Notebook using Anaconda. We'll be using Colab or Jupyter Notebook, but also space in your Google Drive: this will be nice example of hosting a small data science project with your own services.

- You need to downloaded data from https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-usa
- A free student account on Carto, Tableau... etc. 

For Tableau - https://www.tableau.com/academic/students
For Carto - https://carto.com/help/getting-started/student-accounts/

### What you will submit:
A link to your Github repo. The repo must contain... **list what is needed.**

## Why is this lab important?
In this lab we will be learning how to groupby, sort and export data using Python and how to plot on Tableau / Carto with the help of county name.

## Getting the Data
You need to download data from Kaggle (you need to create a free account on Kaggle to download the data). You can download the data from here: https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-usa.
# Tutorial

### Python Script: 
Step 1 - You need to update the exercise.py with desired states that you want to use by putting them in filter and exporting the data accordingly.  
Step 2 - The file you recieve should be saved as in Excel Workbook format. 

### Tableau plot:

Step 1 - Open Tableau
Step 2 - Upload the data by click on Excel on the left
Step 3 - In the bottom left, click on Sheet 1.
Step 4 - Drag the County column on the left in Details within Marks.
Step 5 - Drag the County column and Cases in Label.
Step 6 - Zoom according to the states you have selected.
Step 7 - Right click on the map and click on Cpoy and then Image and click on Copy. Once you will copy it you can save it anywhere either on Word, Paint or directly on Github using the Paste option or Command + V (for Mac) and Ctrl + V (for Windows).

### Creating a Finished Product with Carto
Explain what their output should be (e.g. GeoJSON, a CSV, a Shapefile) and then link to the service we want to use for finishing (e.g. Tableau). Be sure to link to a tutorial or instructions about uploading the files to that service. For example...
- Uploading your data to Carto will require formatting your output in the following way... 
- Sign in to Carto in with your Github account (remember, you *must* have signed up for Github's student developer pack to use Carto: using a regular free Github account will not work). 
- [start here with a walk through about how to upload new data](https://carto.com/help/tutorials/getting-started-with-carto-builder/).
- To create a new map, [start with Carto's documentation here](https://carto.com/help/tutorials/using-builder/).
- Publish, Update, and share your maps! ([More details on this at Carto](https://carto.com/help/tutorials/publishing-and-sharing-maps/)).
