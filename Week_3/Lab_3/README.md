# Lab 3 Title here!
Briefly explain the tutorial and link to any available external outputs, such as a Tableau map.   

### To complete this assignment you will need:
- A Google account. We'll be using Colab, but also space in your Google Drive: this will be nice example of hosting a small data science project with your own services.
- Data downloaded from .... **Provide links**
- A free student account on Carto, Tableau... etc. **Provide links**

### What you will submit:
A link to your Github repo. The repo must contain... **list what is needed.**

## Why is this lab important?
Briefly explain the concept behind the lab. Is it technical, e.g. concatenating spreadsheets, or is it substantive, using Covid Data... 

# Getting the Data
Provide detailed instructions for what data to download, any code required to do this, and where the data should be placed (e.g. in a particular directory or imported to Colab)..

# Write Tutorial Here
Write instructions / tutorial steps here. 

If you need to use code blocks, here is how to format them:
```python
# Importing packages...
import ...

```
Add more instructions as needed! You can add images by putting them in the `images` folder and linking them like this: 
![An Image of Marx](images/Marxxx.png)

Add more instructions as needed! 

# Creating a Finished Product with Carto
Explain what their output should be (e.g. GeoJSON, a CSV, a Shapefile) and then link to the service we want to use for finishing (e.g. Tableau). Be sure to link to a tutorial or instructions about uploading the files to that service. For example...
- Uploading your data to Carto will require formatting your output in the following way... 
- Sign in to Carto in with your Github account (remember, you *must* have signed up for Github's student developer pack to use Carto: using a regular free Github account will not work). 
- [start here with a walk through about how to upload new data](https://carto.com/help/tutorials/getting-started-with-carto-builder/).
- To create a new map, [start with Carto's documentation here](https://carto.com/help/tutorials/using-builder/).
- Publish, Update, and share your maps! ([More details on this at Carto](https://carto.com/help/tutorials/publishing-and-sharing-maps/)). 

# Citation
If we use other sources, it's good to cite them here even if it is not required.
