# Introducing Google Earth Engine (GEE)
These activities introduce students to [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/), which is a geospatial processing service that uses an in-browser development environment to access and analyze Google's enormous library of geospatial data. Everything runs in browser (I use [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) just to be safe) so you don't have to have students install any additional software. However, students do need to sign up for the service and should have a Google account with space in their Google drive to hold any outputs.

**This folder contains two primary activities:**
- `GEE_codealong` contains two "code along" activities. The first introducing students to the basics of JavaScript and providing a basic introduction to the functionality of the GEE development environment, while the second takes them through their first geospatial analysis and visualization in GEE.
-  `GEE_analysis` points students to an existing GEE tutorial, which can be done as an assignment or a code-along, and introduces a coding challenge they must complete on their own, based on what they learned in the tutorial. I generally deliver the `README` in this folder as the instructions. 

### Purpose of these Activities
These activities can be implemented at any point during the course. I always try to introduce students to new technology and GIS is increasingly trending towards coding and, specifically, coding to access data and computing power in "[the cloud](https://www.zdnet.com/article/stop-saying-the-cloud-is-just-someone-elses-computer-because-its-not/)" versus the standard desktop approach. It's also fun to introduce students to a new programming language and the language used by the Earth Engine IDE is JavaScript. Most students in this class have completed my 6 week module in Python programming and are comfortable with that language. Showing them that they can use their experience with Python to quickly pick up another language gives them a nice boost and, besides, it's fantastic to see outputs rendered on an interactive map.

Finally, this class does require an exploratory final project in which the students choose a new technology to explore and... well... explores it! Those in the class who have a special interest in remote sensing or raster data analysis often appreciate having GEE as an option.

## Citation
The activities in the `GEE_codealong` folder were developed by [Priscilla Baltezar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/priscilla-baltezar-80516080/) who first introduced me to GEE and graciously presented in one of the first classes I taught at Clark. The tutorials in the `GEE_codealong` folder come from the [Google Earth Engine Community's MODIS NDVI Times Series Animation](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/community/modis-ndvi-time-series-animation#2_define_clipping_and_region_boundary_geometries), which can also be found on the [Google Earth Engine Github](https://github.com/google/earthengine-community/blob/master/tutorials/modis-ndvi-time-series-animation/index.md).
