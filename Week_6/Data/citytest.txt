My favorite city is Toronto; it is a great city for three reasons which are is to live, work, and for tourism. The first reason is that Toronto is great city to live. It is quiet, clean and safe city to live in. Also, it is multicultural city, which is advantage for us, we could learn about different countries and cultures. For example, I remember when I was in high school that we celebrated the Multicultural Day. On that day everyone wore their cultural clothes, brought and shared cultural foods, also there were some representatives from each culture shared some important aspects of each culture. As a result I learned about different cultures and languages in Toronto. Toronto is good for education. They give more freedom to people. For example, in Toronto you could study as much you can, but back home in Sri Lanka we can only study up to certain age. The second reason is Toronto is good place to find a decent job. Toronto has many companies & factories; therefore we could get job related to our field which we are studying in. Moreover, we have lot of opportunities to start small business in Toronto. Furthermore there are many fast food restaurants so we could find job as part time. For example, most of the students in Toronto working as part time in fast food restaurants. So they could experience themselves in working field. Finally, Toronto has many interesting places for tourists. I would like to talk about few spots which are CN Tower and Air Canada Center. 

Morevoer, it's better than El Paso, Texas. I also like it more than London, England, and Paris, France. Although Paris, Texas is okay.
