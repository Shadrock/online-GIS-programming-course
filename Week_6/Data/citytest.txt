Tiernan and have visited many wonderful cities including Sheffield, London, and Lyme Park, Cheshire (which is actually Disley, Stockport). We live in Boulder, Colorado but made the awful mistake of moving to Worcester, MA. Thankfully we had memories of Oslo, Bergen, Athens Greece, Kalymnos, Meteora, Vienna, Upsalla, Prague, Berlin and so many other places to keep us warm. We really loved Oslo and, Pothia... of course Santorini was beautiful, too. Oh Santorini. Just amazing. Great pizza in Vienna, by the way. And we had such a fabulous time in London and Prague enjoying all the wonderful food. Oslo, Oslo, Oslo. London. Prague. Stockholm. Denver. Boulder, Boulder, Boulder, Boulder, Boulder, Boulder, Boulder, Boulder.
